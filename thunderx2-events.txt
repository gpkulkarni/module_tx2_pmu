L3C events:
============

read_request:
	Number of Read requests received by the L3 Cache.
	This includes Read as well as Read Exclusives.

read_hit:
	Number of Read requests received by the L3 cache that were hit
	in the L3 (Data provided form the L3)

writeback_request:
	Number of Write Backs received by the L3 Cache. These are basically
	the L2 Evicts and writes from the PCIe Write Cache.

inv_nwrite_request:
	Number of Invalidate and Write requests received by the L3 Cache.
	Also Writes from IO that did not go through the PCIe Write Cache.

inv_nwrite_hit
	Number of Invalidate and Write requests received by the L3 Cache
	that were a hit in the L3 Cache.

inv_request:
	Number of Invalidate requests received by the L3 Cache.

inv_hit:
	Number of Invalidate requests received by the L3 Cache that were a
	hit in the L3 Cache.

evict_request:
	Number of Evicts that the L3 cache generated.

NOTE:
1. Granularity of all these event counter values are cache line length(64 bytes)
2. L3C cache Hit Ratio = (read_hit + inv_nwrite_hit + inv_hit) / (read_request + inv_nwrite_request + inv_request)

DMC events:
============
cnt_cycles:
	Count cycles (Clocks at the DMC clock rate)

write_txns:
	Number of 64 Bytes write transactions received by the DMC(s)

read_txns:
	Number of 64 Bytes Read transactions received by the DMC(s)

data_transfers:
	Number of 64 Bytes data transferred to or from DRAM.
